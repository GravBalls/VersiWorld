<h3>Working Title</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VersiWorld</p>

<h3>Game Objective</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a ball into a goal.</p>

<h3>Player Role</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Player will be given simple controls that they can use to manipulate the world that the ball is in, these controls will vary per level (and will each be clearly marked). The player will have an unobstructed side view of the entire level as the game will be more of a puzzle.</p>

<h3>Physics Mechanics</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective ball will be a simple physics based ball traveling through an environment that will often contain other physics objects. The player's control of the world will be include changing an objects properties (friction, bounciness, etc.) or activating objects like moving platforms, as well as changing the entire world's properties like gravity.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game will be set up as a puzzle and the "fun" of the game is from discovering how each control works and using a and overcoming the limited control set to solve the puzzles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan for implementation will start with control so we can standardize how objects in the world respond to the player's input, then we will move onto implementing these objects before moving to the design of the levels.</p>
