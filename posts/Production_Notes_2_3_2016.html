                This project started out as a puzzle game where the player would solve set small pieces by manipulating the environment through limited one button controls. After Jeff showed 
                me the level idea he created we changed our spec to the more skill driven design we are currently working with, adding full gravity control as well as the old control scheme 
                for manipulating to give the game more complexity.
            </p>

            <p>
                We organized ourselves by setting up a trello bar, determining tasks and organizing ourselves Independently of each other. Jeff focused on keeping our version control intact 
                while I made sure we were generally headed in the right direction with our work.

                The biggest problems I have had through this project come from the over planning. Despite the fact that we are working on a prototype I keep finding myself trying to make more 
                complicated scripts when getting the work done simply is more safer and more effective to begin with. Now that we have our features complete all we have to do is make the content 
                to show off our mechanics and then hook them all together.
