	<p>As we got started with planning, Quinn and I sketched out a plan on the whiteboard.  Multi-level puzzler that uses different physics mechanics to effect the environment 
	and player.  A task list was setup on Trello.com and we got started. Working on the structure of the objects and trying to ensure a nice abstract class was or first task, 
	and we spent about a week implementing different mechanics in a prototype setting.   This order of tasks I believe was a mistake.  I think we took too long thinking about 
	engineering a perfect code base instead of trying to get something up and able to be play tested as quick as possible.</p>
	
	<p>Over the weekend, I had a thought, and built a quick and dirty little prototype of a level and started to play test it.  I actually thought it was kind of fun.  It wasn’t 
	exactly what we had specified in our production brief, but the main gist I think was there.  The new design is a multi-level game with a rectangular border, a single player 
	object (a sphere) and a number of targets / hunters placed in scene in a semi random way.  When he game starts, gravity is normal (things fall from top to bottom, y-axis) and 
	the player is placed at the bottom of the border and some number of targets are spawned “mid-air”. The user controls the environment by using the arrow keys (or controller D-pad) 
	to change the direction of gravity in the world to whichever direction the user chooses.  The target/hunters and player then succumb to gravity’s forces appropriately.  The goal 
	is for the player to ‘collect’ all targets by colliding with them in a timed session. Inside the borders are 1 or more ‘bumpers’ who give something interesting for the 
	target/hunters and player to bounce off of.  The bumper is 2 cubes in same position, with one of them rotated 45 degrees to make a ‘star’ pattern. This gives many angles 
	for the objects to react from.  If a target hit’s the bumper it is changed to a hunter. Now if player collides the player fails and the level ends. This makes some interesting 
	dynamics between not having direct control of your player, and the randomness of the bounce when the targets (cube) bounce off border or bumpers.</p>
	
	<h3>Lessons</h3>
	<p>I upgraded my Unity version to the latest rev without thinking about it.  Of course there was a breaking bug in it with regards to the use of my particles.  I had to rollback 
	top previous build num and this causes some issues syncing the project.  I had lost assets, and generally an unhappy unity.  I rolled back the project a couple of check-ins 
	(before I upgraded the Unity) and copied it over. Now all is well again. Don’t play with your tools when you’re in the middle of a project, this is a life lesson.</p>
