            <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
            <p>
                For this project we started with our concept laid out our mechanics before implementing the mechanics. Our plans were to
                get the mechanics done and then create our levels, but once we were done creating the mechanics we decided to go with a
                much less puzzle oriented design. In the future we may want to work on some level designs before implementing the mechanics.
                In our case we were still able to use or re-purpose our stuff, but on other projects we might not be as lucky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of major changes in design our biggest problem was our code design. We both immediately tried to create robust and
                complex designs that we wanted to have fully planned from the start when having simpler code that did exactly what we needed
                in a small amount of code was more effective anyway. Further into the project we both realized this and made our code short,
                simple and functional before adding further functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                A major lesson Jeff learned came from Unity's destructive 5.3 patch. In upgrading his version of Unity mid-project (as well as
                some other tools) he found that it changed multiple important aspects of the engine, rendering our game broken until he returned
                his version to the previous one.
            </p>

            <p>
                My most major lesson came from the planning that I took responsibility for. To organize the project, we used Trello to make sure
                we weren't going to both do the same thing. Our organization went well overall but I did take note that we sometimes strayed from
                the board, made some conflicting cards and ended working on code that didn't necessarily have to do with this project in particular.
                Due to the nature of this project I decided it was okay to let ourselves do this as it let us explore more code, but in the future
                we may need to lock down and make sure that we are on task, In the future we may also want to leave the Trello management to someone
                in particular to help keep it more structured.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall this project went well as we did what we set off to do and any sidetracking we did only helped us find new ways to code.
